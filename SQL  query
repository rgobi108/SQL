Question:
Given two tables, Customers and Orders, write a SQL query to retrieve the names of customers who have placed at least two orders.

Tables:

Customers Table:

diff

+----+----------+
| ID | Name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Alice    |
| 2  | Bob      |
| 3  | Carol    |
+----+----------+
Orders Table:

diff

+-----+------------+
| ID  | CustomerID |
+-----+------------+
| 101 | 1          |
| 102 | 1          |
| 103 | 2          |
| 104 | 3          |
+-----+------------+
Expected Output:

diff

+-------+
| Name  |
+-------+
| Alice |
+-------+
SQL Query:

sql

SELECT c.Name
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.ID = o.CustomerID
GROUP BY c.ID
HAVING COUNT(o.ID) >= 2;



Explanation:

We perform an inner join between the Customers and Orders tables on the ID and CustomerID columns, respectively.
The GROUP BY clause groups the results by the ID of each customer.
The HAVING clause filters the results to include only those customers who have at least two orders (COUNT(o.ID) >= 2).
We select the Name column from the Customers table for the final result.
This query retrieves the names of customers who have placed at least two orders. It demonstrates the usage of JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses in SQL queries.
